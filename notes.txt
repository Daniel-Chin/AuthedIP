    benchmark
        traffic volume * n_links
            how much increase?
        latency per packet
            includes 
                endhost signing and unboxing
                router smartness
        router throughput
            no simulation for this! Just reason. 
            should be 50% when check_prob = 100%. 
            91% when check_prob = 10%. 
        traffic volume per verfier server
            realtime verification power. 
    DoS response
    
    Network topology is 1D for each case. 
    Use IP over socket. 
    subscription is not simulated.

    Benefits
        the blocking policy is much simpler. 
            much easier to tell attacks from benign high-rate traffic.
    
    may open with the problem with ethane, and attacks against ethane. 
    
    limitation
        attacker may brute force a sequence of signatures for the future. 
        Controller announces salt every hour?
