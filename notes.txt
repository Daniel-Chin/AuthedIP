3/11 office hour: 
    how to cast a packet to two dests? 
        just copy into two packets. 
    how to do the experiment?
        I can have routers? 
    anything probablistic is unconventional in security
    one thing I can do: analyze the attacks for eThane

Inside vs Outside
the first authedip router: rando check. 
    Don't need to mark the packet as checked! Because the security response is off-line. It's almost-real-time policing. 
scream for help. 
    through Controller. 
verification: server
    notifies 1st authedip router. 
    actively subscribes to 1st authedip routers, to avoid getting flooded. 
IP protocol update that is back-compatible. 
    h = hash(source, dest, content)
    t = timestamp()
    s = sign(concat(t, h))

attack: duplicate recent packets to DoS

limitations
    may need salting to prevent slow brute force of signature. Controller should declare salt of the day.
