overview

threat model / protocol


context:
    AITF 
        active internet traffic filtering
    AIP
        accountable inet protocol

simplify so that
    leave out hash
    treat hashing as a refinement
        hash halves traffic

put signature in IP options
    or not. AITF used beginning of IP payload. 

simulate the "network" with sockets. 
"overlay network"
start testing soon
measure performance
    get benchmark of no-auth IP
    compare with auth IP
    compare with auth IP with hash
    how to account for the slowness of python? 
        proportional dilation? 
        (but that will be so much work...)
